# Building_Blocks
This project is inspired from a game named "MineCraft". Here the concept of MineCraft is used. You can build blocks, break blocks, change blocks. Using these three functionalities you can build structures as you want. Some complexity is also added. Like you will have fixed amount of blocks in you stock. If you need more blocks than you have to break from the scene and use for building structures. If you enter in a hole that is created after breaking the blocks the game will end at that moment.

//You have to download the glm folder and add into include folder and you are ready to go.
